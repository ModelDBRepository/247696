  <p/> Example: Open the supplied model file in opencor. Change the
  ending point to 48 Hours, the point interval to 0.01, and open two
  graphs (click plus sign twice). For the first graph right-clicking
  Vm in m list (select Plot against intergration variable), and for
  the second right click V and select to plot against -> D ->D. Finaly
  run (click upper left play triangle) creates the following graph
  similar to fig 3's inset and dotted lines:<p/>
